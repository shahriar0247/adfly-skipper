I was always frustrated about the adfly thing, even tho i use an adblocker. I did see adfly skippers already on the web, but didnt really wanna download it. I used to copy the destination url from the top (the dest="url" in adfly) and use URI decoder to get my destination url. I thought of creating a extenison that does this <br>

All it does is skip adfly, but looking at the url you are visiting, getting the desination url from the whole url, and uri decoding it to get your destination url and loading that url up.
